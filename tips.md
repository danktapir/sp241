# TIPS

* Tip#1
  Understand the Kernel: Start with a high-level understanding of the Linux kernel architecture.
  Resources like "Linux Kernel Development" by Robert Love can be very helpful.  
* Tip#2
  Master low-level languages
  C/C++: These languages are the primary tools for system programming due to their performance and low-level capabilities.
* Tip#3
  Linux From Scratch (LFS): Go through the LFS book to understand how a Linux system is built from the ground up.
  This will give you insight into the inner workings of the OS. You can watch this YouTube channel: [Kernotex](https://www.youtube.com/@Kernotex). It really helps!
* Tip#4
  Basics of Kernel Modules: Learn the structure of a kernel module, how to write and compile them.
  Start with "Hello World" kernel module.
